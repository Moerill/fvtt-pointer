# Important Information!

## Maintenance Mode  

This repository is no longer receiving active attention. In my opinion this module is complete and stable, and i'll be focusing my efforts on other modules/stuff. PR's are welcome and i'll try to investigate bugs and keep this module up to date with Foundry, when i find the time to do so.  
That said, feel free to keep suggesting features, if i find something interesting i may end up implementing it.

## FVTT Version compatibility

My focus is the FVTTs stable branch. I will neither promise nor prioritise updates for FVTTs beta or alpha branches! Feel free to report a bug so i know whats coming, but don't expect a fix before a stable FVTT update.

## Bug Reporting and Feature Suggestions

Any issues, bugs, or feature requests are always welcome to be reported directly to the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Moerill/fvtt-pointer/issues ) and create an issue with the template fitting to what you want to post and follow its instructions, or using the [Bug Reporter Module](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/bug-reporter/).

**I will ignore/delete half-hearted bug reports ignoring the issue template or Discord mentions!**  
Its not difficult to put at least some effort into something that you want someone else to put their spare time into to fix!

All were slightly modified to fully fill their square and width/height attributes were added so they're compatible with FVTT as SVG.

## Support the development

I'm doing this project mostly alone (with partial help of some wonderful people) in my spare time and for free.  
If you want to encourage me to keep doing this, i am happy about all kind of tokens of appreciation. (Like some nice words, recommending this project or contributions to the project).  
What about donations? I do feel very honored that you think about giving me a donation! But instead I'd prefer if you send the cash to a good cause of your choosing

# Feature Overview

Press buttons, stuff happens!  
Press a button and a pointer will follow your mouse, while the button is pressed. Press another button and a stationary ping will appear at your cursors position, which will disappear after some time. As GM you can even press another different button and a stationary ping will appear *and* every players view will get moved to that ping!  

## Settings Menu

The pointer, pings and buttons are customizable using the settings menu. Here you can choose different images, or videos and apply some basic transformations as well as animations to them.  
To make setup easier for players the GM can decide to force his settings onto all players! (This will not stop them from changing those afterwards.)  

### Creating Pointers and Pings

![](doc/design_studio.webp) 

1. GM View of the design studio (1). 

2. Here you can which custom pointer you want to use as pointer or as ping. Just click on one of the checkboxes. The GM can also create new custom pointer or delete any existing.

3. A small preview of your custom pointer. the red X in the center is the location of your mouse pointer when displaying the pointer on the canvas. This view help to properly position your chosen image relative to your mouse pointer.  

Clicking on the canvas lets you also choose the image or video file used for the custom pointer. You can choose of all file types compatible with core FVTTs canvas.

4. Configuration panel for your pointer. Configure some basic transformations, like position, rotation and add some animations.

Due to core FVTT limitations it is currently only possible for users allowed to edit world settings to create and delete custom pointer. (Screenshot below)

*Beware that this allows them to edit most FVTT settings. It is up to you, the GM, whether you trust your players with that much power!*
